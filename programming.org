What is the open closed principle?

**** Answer

Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc...) should be open for
extension, but closed for modification.

-- Bertrand Meyer


There's some contention about it's viability at Jon Skeet's blog.  He suggests a
better variation of:

http://codeblog.jonskeet.uk/2013/03/15/the-open-closed-principle-in-review/

"Identify points of predicted variation and create a stable interface around
them."

Which is similar to Bloch's advice of "design for inheritance or prohibit it."

How to do you get the min and max value of a number type in Java?

**** Answer

Integer.MIN_VALUE
Integer.MAX_VALUE

Long.MIN_VALUE
Long.MAX_VALUE

For floating point, the min value is actually the smallest magnitude or smallest
/absolute/ number.  If you want the most negative number, you do
-Float.MAX_VALUE.  That works since IEEE754 is symmetric around 0, unlike ints

Float.MIN_VALUE
Float.MAX_VALUE

Double.MIN_VALUE
Double.MAX_VALUE

Really you should use:

Float.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
Float.POSITIVE_INFINITY

Double.NEGATIVE_INFINITY
Double.POSITIVE_INFINITY

Can you overload a method by return type in Java?

**** Answer

No, because you are not required to capture the the return value of a method in
Java, so the compiler cannot pick between two methods.

#+BEGIN_SRC java
boolean doSomething() {}
int doSomething() {}

doSomething();
#+END_SRC

This limitation is part of Java, but not the JVM.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
[[http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Class.html#getMethod-java.lang.String-java.lang.Class][Class.getMethod(String, Class...)]]

Note that there may be more than one matching method in a class because while
the Java language forbids a class to declare multiple methods with the same
signature but different return types, the Java virtual machine does not. This
increased flexibility in the virtual machine can be used to implement various
language features. For example, covariant returns can be implemented with bridge
methods; the bridge method and the method being overridden would have the same
signature but different return types.

When are Java classes intialized?

**** Answer

A class or interface is initialized on first access of non-compile-time constant:

+ assigning compile time constants
+ recursively initializing the superclass
+ processing the static initializers (if not already complete)

Initialization does not occur when accessing fields that are compile time constants.

How would you keep track of a median while getting a stream of numbers?

**** Answer

Use a balanced binary tree where instead of keeping track of the height of the
left and right nodes, we keep track of the number of elements.

A better solution, that doesn't involve new data structures is to use a min heap
and a max heap.  Python only provides a min-heap, so you can fake a max-heap by
multiplying by each number by -1 before inserting and then reversing it on a
pop or get-min.

How would you implement a hash table?

**** Answer

Use an array of lists, normally referred to as buckets.  This method is
chaining.

Start with some default capacity.  Java HashMap is 16

insert(key, value)
call hashCode to get an int and take it mod length of the array.

Once you get past some threshold, Java's is 75% load factor, you resize the
array.

get(key)

Use hashcode to find the bucket and search the list to find the item.

What is Hopscotch hashing?

**** Answer

Scheme for resolving hash collisions in a table using open addressing.

Each item is guaranteed to be in the neighborhood of the hashed bucket.  In
other words, the item will always be in the original array entry, or in the next
H-1 neighboring entries.

Each bucket contains a hop-information word, an H-bit bitmap, indicating which
of the next H buckets belong to the neighborhood.

To insert an item, use a linear probe to find some spot in the neighborhood of
entry i.

If there is no such spot, find some entry between i and j that could go to j and
still be in the neighborhood.

If you can't fit the new entry or if bucket i contains H items, resize the
table.

Well suited for concurrent hash table and provides good performance at load
factors exceeding 0.9.

What is Coalesced hashing?

**** Answer

Scheme for resolving hash collisions in a table a hybrid of chaining and open
addressing.

Like chaining, except instead of a list, you reuse buckets of the backing
array.

+ Compute h(k)
+ If there's an item there, find the first open spot and link from the collision
+ If a different key get inserted into another chain, the values are said to
  coalesce.
+ Follow the links until you find an empty spot.

An important optimization is to only hash values to a subset of the table and
leave room for a "cellar" of values instead of coalescing.

Empirical analysis shows that you should use 86% of the size for hashing and
reserve 14% for the cellar.

Whats the difference between threads and processes?

**** Answer

A process is an executing instance of a program.  Process provides resources
necessary to execute a program.  A process has:

+ Virtual address space
+ executable code
+ Open handles to system objects
+ a security context
+ A unique PID (process identifier)
+ At least one thread of execution

A thread is the entity within the process that can be scheduled for execution.
Threads share virtual address space of a process.  Each thread maintains:

+ Shared virtual address space from the process
+ Exception handlers
+ scheduling priority
+ thread local storage
+ a unique thread identifier
+ a set of structures to save the thread context until it is scheduled

2. Eases the maintenance burden because modules can be understood more quickly
   and debugged with little fear of harming other modules.
3. Modules can be optimized with affecting the correctness of other modules.
4. Increases software reuse because modules that aren't tightly coupled can be
   used in unrelated contexts.

What are the advantages of a static factory over a constructor?

**** Answer

1. Unlike constructors, static factories have names.
2. Unlike constructors, static factories don't have to create a new object every
   time.
3. Unlike constructors, static factories Can return an object of any subtype of
   their return type.
4. They reduce the verbosity of creating parameterized type instances, negated by
   Java diamond operator.

+ of - concise alternative to valueOf
+ getInstance - returns instance that is described by parameters but doesn't
  have same value.  Singleton is the degenerate case.
+ newInstance - like getInstance, but guarantees that each instance is distinct
  from all others
+ getType - like getInstance but used when the factory method is in a different
  class.  Type indicates the return type.
+ new/Type/ - like new instance, but with a new /Type/

You might have a grouping of static methods like ~java.util.Arrays~ or utility functions.

Make a class noninstaniable by including a private constructor and throw an AssertationError.

This will also prevent the class from being subclassed.

The best way to handle it is to let the object fall out of scope.

When will you typically see obsolete references (memory leaks)?

**** Answer

+ Whenever a class manages it's own memory - a stack
+ Caches - weak references
+ Listeners and callbacks

What are the issues with finalizers?

**** Answer

Womanizer slap ref, double-slap spider web, Conner "accept", zombie

They are unpredictable, often dangerous and generally unnecessary.

+ Unpredictable - no guarantee on execution, never do anything time critical in a finalizer
+ Severe performance penalty for using finalizers versus regular garbage collection.
+ Concurrent execution of finalizers can leave graph-like data structures in a
  corrupt state.
+ Uncaught exceptions in finalizers are ignored and not reported.
+ Finalizers can resurrect objects in corrupt states

**** Answer

fork, change random colors, parent, privacy drapes.

1. Each instance of the class is inherently unique, e.g a Thread.
2. You don't care if the class provides a logical equality test.
   java.util.Random probably doesn't need a logical equals.
3. A superclass override equals and the behavior is appropriate for this
   subclass.
4. The class is private or package private and you know equals is never called.
   In which case, you should override it and throw an assertion error.

   performance optimization.
2. Use the instanceof operator to check if the argument has the right type.  You
   don't need to check for null with instanceof.
3. Cast the argument to the correct type.  The preceeding instanceof guarantees
   that it will succeed.
4. Check equality in all the significant fields of the class.
5. Check to see if it obeys the general contract, reflexive, symmetric,
   transitive, consistent and non-nullity.

2. Compute an int hashCode c for each field in the Object.
   + boolean: f ? 1 : 0;
   + char, byte, short, int: (int) f
   + long: (int) (f ^ (f >>> 32))
   + float: Float.floatToIntBits(f);
   + double: Double.doubletoLongBits(f);
   + object: call hashCode.  If null, return 0 (customary).
   + array: compute significant values with these rules.  If everything is
     significant, call Arrays.hashCode.
3. Combine the hashCode c from step 2 into result with:

   result = 31 * result + c;

constructor.

How should you implement clone if you must?

**** Answer

 http://www.agiledeveloper.com/articles/cloning072002.htm

+ Implement the clone method that calls a protected copy constructor
+ Use a protected copy constructor to initialize final fields, protected so you
  don't get tight dependencies.
+ clone the instance fields in the copy constructor.
+ Now you can extend the class and make it work with a new copy constructor.
 
#+BEGIN_SRC java
public class Person implements Cloneable
{
	private final Brain brain; // brain is final since I do not want 
				// any transplant on it once created!
	private int age;
	public Person(Brain aBrain, int theAge)
	{
		brain = aBrain; 
		age = theAge;
	}
 	protected Person(Person another)
	{
		Brain refBrain = null;
		try
		{
			refBrain = (Brain) another.brain.clone();
			// You can set the brain in the constructor
		}
		catch(CloneNotSupportedException e) {}
		brain = refBrain;
		age = another.age;
	}
 	public String toString()
	{
		return "This is person with " + brain;
		// Not meant to sound rude as it reads!
	}
 	public Object clone()
	{
		return new Person(this);

What is the general contract of Comparable?

**** Answer

- Reflexive: ~sgn(x.compareTo(y)) == -sgn(y.compareTo(x))~
- Transitive: ~(x.compareTo(y) > 0 && y.compareTo(z) > 0~ implies
  ~x.compareTo(z) > 0~
- Symmetry: ~x.compareTo(y) == 0~ implies that ~sgn(x.compareTo(z)) ==
  sgn(y.compareTo(z))~
- Strongly recommended that if ~x.compareTo(y) == 0~ then ~x.equals(y)~

What is the problem with comparable and a extending a value class?

**** Answer

There is no way to extend an instantiable class with a new value component while
preserving the compareTo contract.

If you want to add a value component to a class that implements Comparable,
write an unrelated class containing an instance of the first class and provide a
view method that returns the instance.  Then, you are free to implement your own
~compareTo~.

Consider these two classes:

#+BEGIN_SRC java
class NamedThing {
    String name;
}

class Person extends NamedThing {
    Date dateOfBirth;
}
#+END_SRC

NamedThing should compare based on ~name~.  Person should compare on ~name~,
then ~dateOfBirth~.  But what if we compare NamedThing to Person.

Unlike method invocation, inheritance violates encapsulation.

If you try to implement InstrumentedHashSet by extending HashSet, you must rely

**** Answer

Wrapper classes are not suited for use in callback frameworks.
Annoying and tedious to write.

When is inheritance appropriate?

**** Answer

In circumstances where the subclass really is a subtype of the superclass.

Class B should only extend class A only if B "is-a" A.

If you are tempted to have class B extend a class A, ask yourself: Is every B
really an A?  If you cannot truthfully answer yes, B should not extend A.

You must also be comfortable in adopting the flaws of A.

What aspect of an inheritable class must you document?

**** Answer

You must document the self-use of overridable methods.  For each public or
protected method or constructor, the documentation must indicate which
overridable methods the method or constructor invokes, in what sequence and how
the results of each invocation affect subsequent processing.

Overridable means nonfinal and either public or protected.

Why can't you use overridable methods in a constructor?

**** Answer

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Because the superclass constructor runs before the subclass constructor, so the
overriding methods in the subclass will get invoked before the subclass
constructor has run.  If the overriding method depends on any initialization
performed by the subclass constructor, the method will not behave as expected.
#+END_QUOTE

#+BEGIN_SRC java

public class ConstructorCallsOverride {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        abstract class Base {
            Base() { overrideMe(); }
            abstract void overrideMe(); 
        }
        class Child extends Base {
            final int x;
            Child(int x) { this.x = x; }
            @Override void overrideMe() {
                System.out.println(x);
            }
        }
        new Child(42); // prints "0"
    }
}
#+END_SRC

Here, when Base constructor calls overrideMe, Child has not finished
initializing the final int x, and the method gets the wrong value. This will
almost certainly lead to bugs and errors.

No, because clone and readObject function similar to constructors, so the same
restrictions apply.

Neither clone nor readObject may invoke an overridable method, directly or
indirectly.

If you must allow inheritance from a concrete class that doesn't implement a
standard interface, how can you mitigate the risks of improper inheritance?

**** Answer

Ensure the class never invokes any of its overridable methods and document this
fact.  Then, overriding a method will never affect the behavior of any other
method.

You can do this by moving the body of each overridable method into a private
helper method and then call the helper method from the overridable method.
Then, replace each self-use of an overridable method with its private helper.

What are the seven mutual benefits of exploring value with clients?

**** Answer

1. Creates Trust - asking probing questions shows you're interested in
   understanding their unique problem.
2. Fosters Alignment - It's very helpful to agree on two points, Point A and
   Point B.  Point A is pain points. Point B is questions about goals.  A & B
   give immense clarity.
3. Helps your client better evaluate vendors - the deciding factor becomes who
   can deliver value versus what the price is.
4. Frames the Solution as an investment, not an expense - no one likes expenses
   and the exploration process makes the price an investment for an ROI
5. Inspires action - By helping a client to picture point B, they become
   emotionally involved and inspired to act.
6. Lets your client make an informed business decision - Offer options,
   i.e. price discrimination
7. Establishes a trusted partnership - After the first six benefits, clients see
   the impact of your work and champion for you.

Why are goals bad?

**** Answer

1. Goals delay happiness.  Goal oriented exist in state of pre-success failure
   at best, or permanent failure.  Teach yourself to always put happiness off
   until the next milestone.  Hedonic adaptation.
2. Goals derail long-term progress.  Goals redirect focus from processes to
   outcomes.  After achieving goal, people fall back into old habits,
   e.g. cyclical weight loss.
3. Goals lure us into belieiving we can control the future.  Everest climbers
   made goal a part of their identity and jeopordized themselves to get the goal.

How do you systemize your ONE thing with cue-habit-reward and implementation

**** Answer

System one down: Cue, Habit, Reward, Contingencies

Use implementation intention.

Identify a trigger.  The best triggers are immediately preceeding actions - like
an existing habit, e.g. eating, showering, waking up.

Identify ONE thing to do immediately after your cue.  For example, "After I
return home from work on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays, I will go for a run
for five miles."

Use a stupid simple behavior that's really easy to do.

Account for contingencies:

If I return home and the weather does not permit, I will go running in the
morning instead.

**** Answer

#+BEGIN_SRC 

INDEX(Table1,                                     // The table to search
      MATCH([@[Last Name]], Table1[Last Name]),   // Get the row of the last name in a specific column.
      3)                                          // Column number to pull from, starts from 1
#+END_SRC
