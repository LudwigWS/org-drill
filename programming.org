What is the median?  How is defined for an odd set of number and an even set of
numbers?

**** Answer
It's the middle number.  If the number of elements is even, the median is the
mean of the middle two numbers.

What is the Singleton pattern?

**** Answer

Singleton is a class which only has one instance in a whole application. The
class provides a getInstance() method to access the singleton instances.

What are the advantages of a Singleton pattern?

**** Answer

+ Singletons can implement interfaces and inherit from other classes.
+ Singletons can be lazy loaded.  Handy for expensive resources or DB connections.
+ Singletons can be extended into a factory.

What are the disadvantages of a Singleton pattern?

**** Answer

+ May introduce global state which makes it harder to reason about code.
+ Encourages tight coupling.
+ Makes unit-testing in isolation difficult.
+ Hides dependencies within the Singleton that can attach to everything.
+ Difficult to parallelize because of mutable state.
+ Inability to subclass because of private constructor.

How would you keep track of a median while getting a stream of numbers?

**** Answer

Use a balanced binary tree where instead of keeping track of the height of the
left and right nodes, we keep track of the number of elements.

A better solution, that doesn't involve new data structures is to use a min heap
and a max heap.  Python only provides a min-heap, so you can fake a max-heap by
multiplying by each number by -1 before inserting and then reversing it on a
pop or get-min.

Whats the difference between threads and processes?

**** Answer

A process is an executing instance of a program.  Process provides resources
necessary to execute a program.  A process has:

+ Virtual address space
+ executable code
+ Open handles to system objects
+ a security context
+ A unique PID (process identifier)
+ At least one thread of execution

A thread is the entity within the process that can be scheduled for execution.
Threads share virtual address space of a process.  Each thread maintains:

+ Shared virtual address space from the process
+ Exception handlers
+ scheduling priority
+ thread local storage
+ a unique thread identifier
+ a set of structures to save the thread context until it is scheduled

What are the advantages of a static factory over a constructor?

**** Answer

1. Unlike constructors, static factories have names.
2. Unlike constructors, static factories don't have to create a new object every
   time.
3. Unlike constructors, static factories Can return an object of any subtype of
   their return type.
4. They reduce the verbosity of creating parameterized type instances, negated by
   Java diamond operator.

What are the disadvantages of static factories?

**** Answer

1. A class without a public or protected constructor cannot be subclassed.
   Blessing in disguise as it forces composition over inheritance.
2. Static factories are not readily distinguishable from other static methods in
   the API docs.

What are common names of a static factory?

**** Answer

+ valueOf - return instance that has the "same" value as parameters.
  Essentially a type conversion.
+ of - concise alternative to valueOf
+ getInstance - returns instance that is described by parameters but doesn't
  have same value.  Singleton is the degenerate case.
+ newInstance - like getInstance, but guarantees that each instance is distinct
  from all others
+ getType - like getInstance but used when the factory method is in a different
  class.  Type indicates the return type.
+ new/Type/ - like new instance, but with a new /Type/

What are the seven mutual benefits of exploring value with clients?

**** Answer

1. Creates Trust - asking probing questions shows you're interested in
   understanding their unique problem.
2. Fosters Alignment - It's very helpful to agree on two points, Point A and
   Point B.  Point A is pain points. Point B is questions about goals.  A & B
   give immense clarity.
3. Helps your client better evaluate vendors - the deciding factor becomes who
   can deliver value versus what the price is.
4. Frames the Solution as an investment, not an expense - no one likes expenses
   and the exploration process makes the price an investment for an ROI
5. Inspires action - By helping a client to picture point B, they become
   emotionally involved and inspired to act.
6. Lets your client make an informed business decision - Offer options,
   i.e. price discrimination
7. Establishes a trusted partnership - After the first six benefits, clients see
   the impact of your work and champion for you.
